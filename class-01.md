## We are asked to read the prescribed chapters and then choose a format from the list on our **Read: 01 - Introductory HTML and JavaScript** and create a reply in our Notes Repo.
Jon Duckett write about the basics of proper HTML, CSS, and JS strucute. They are three different structured languages that while working together to present information to an end user and send back data when needed are also three separate and specific languages.

#### HTML

**HTML** is the skeleton of the web page applications we will be building. It consists of elements defined by tags.
The structure of an HTML document always begins with the declarative “Doctype” tag, letting the browser know what the document is: HTML. Inside this tag lives the HTML tag. The **Head** and the **Body** tags separate the information that will be rendered on to the page. 
HTML by itself will not add either responsiveness or styling to a page on its own but can link up to cascade style sheets (CSS) for presentation and JS scripts for functionality and responsiveness. HTML only pages would load very quickly, and rudimentarily “function” but would not be desirable and would not be considered adequate for a production worthy page. 

#### CSS

**CSS** are the rules that create the presentation of a web page. This works in three ways:

- By “inline” styling: the most prioritized styling but avoided as it can be hard to quickly style a web page application because each element would have to be altered. 
- By “internal” style sheet, where the **Style** tags are used to define the CSS for an HTML document without having to link to an external sheet. This is better than inline style, but not preferred as it is not best practice and the HTML and CSS are still in the same document and a Style Sheet cannot be quickly substituted for a new look.
- By “external” style sheet, where the documents containing the CSS and HTML are linked to each other, which means that the debugging and changing of styles can quickly be replaced without having to edit the HTML skeleton.

#### JS

**Java Script** (js) is the programmatic layer of the web applications we make: while HTML buttons will still upload or function without js, js makes it so that web pages display and behave in defined and structural behaviors based on situations. 
Js makes it so that upload buttons only appear if certain conditions are met, or present submenus if conditions are reached to render them to the end user. Js makes it so that the internet is as interactive and specialized as the computer programmer wants it to be.
