### HTML

##### Tables

Duckett’s HTML book talks about the four keys to tables: **table, th, td, tr**.

The table is a great tool for web building, where the layout is distributed between rows and columns.

The **colspan** and the **rowspan** makes table layout easier when some data from rows and columns share the same information, or even styling a table. 
A cool idea is to give table a certain width and height and give the overflow a y or x scroll.

### JS

#####Objects, Methods, and Functions

While there are many subjects in these pages I thing the most helpful things to study are: 
The browser Object Model on page 124: it is a cheat sheet of many dot notations of a browser beginning with window.
Page 126 helps with the DOM manipulation needed for our most current assignment. This is where the resources needed to better understand how the data will be able to translate from our app.js file to our html markup.

### Domain Modeling 

##### by Sam Hamm

Hamm explains that this concept of domain modeling makes it easier for us devs to understand the apps we build by systematically laying down the required attributes and methods to realize objects on our apps. This is laid out in a way that can be communicated and understood between us technical people and the business side of the clients we work for, which is important since not all project managers will know how to code.
The epic fail example will help us better understand how to make the salmon cookie app, and it can compare between weekly video likes and cookies sold on average: it’s a good resource.
