# Forms and JS Events

### HTML

##### Forms

Forms are used to collect user input. This is how we will continue to add functionality to our app I believe. 

Multiple ways of input are available to us via forms: we can collect text, we can present multiple options and we can make it so only one will be available with **radio** or multiple with **check-boxes** in our forms. 

I believe we will get more in to how to use the get and post methods to send our data later, but for now our main objective is to get familiar with forms to pass data.

##### List, Tables and Forms

We can take the information via the input fields of the form elements, submit them and read the data, and the use tables and lists to show them back on to the page.

A combination of all these elements and data is seen actively in our fish cookie app.

### JS

#####Events

Events show our js where we want them triggered. A button “onClick” can have a function attached to it making it so that it will call our data forward.

Events are numerous and can range between hovering, pressing a key, or just moving a mouse cursor away from an element.  It’s a broad list available to us, using an event comes at the programing needs.
