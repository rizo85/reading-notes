### HTML / CSS

##### Layout

Layout Is the way we organize our website elements for consistent presentation across devices for the end users.

The most consistent way to divide our contents is to use: **header, nav, main, footer** 
Additionally using a wrapper div will hold all our content and can help get rid of unwanted margins while helping target all the styling.
Our **nav** should hold only enough information to help the user navigate around our site or show a logo; its not for extensive content.
Our box model main point of each page should live on **main**, which is to say that a site with multiple pages can share styling but the **main** section of each page will hold unique information, even if in other aspects they look similar to each html document.
