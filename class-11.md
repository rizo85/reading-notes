### HTML

##### IMG tag

Image tags are empty elements comprised only of elements; thereâ€™s atl, src, and whatever CSS we choose to apply. 

#### ALT and SRC

- Alt is the information available if there is some error and the image does not display and alternatively a descriptor of the image for the visually impaired

- SRC: this is the source of the image file translated to the page. The image can be of any supported format and even .gif animated images.

#### Practical information:

The practical information revolved around a brief summary about how search engines will handle your page: why agonize if all you have is a simple online profile. Best to worry about this if you actually have a site and you are actively looking to host and attract visitors.

#### Flash

- Flash was used for animations but its dead now: long live html 5.
