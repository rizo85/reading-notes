### Local Storage

Mark Pilgrim says that the local storage we know know is mostly due to a clever solution found by HTML5.

I used to think cookies were the solution but these are too small, not secure enough most of the time, and can just be slow on your site: not ideal.

Well great news is that HTML 5 we can store to the window object if the browser supports it. 

One of the biggest take aways is that the data is always stored as a string wich means wrapper classes?

Useful, but im not sure how to use this in my everyday just now...
